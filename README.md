This project aims to become a self-host blogging service. Basically your own federated blogging platform of sorts.

## TODO:

User Accounts:

- Add User account security (2fa to sign in options)
- Create the Profile GUI
- Create Account Settings GUI
- Extend the User class for Settings, Privacy, and Content

Blog/Content:

- Create Blog class object
- Create a Content abstraction
- Create the process for creating a new blog in the jLog (the plan is the host will let users create their own blogs)
- Use WYSIWYG editor on the New Blog Post view

System:

- Overall additional classes and such
- Implement in a MVC or related design pattern (for the graphical user interfaces)
- Implement Manager role and Manager settings (basically Server Settings such as IP, HTTPS, MySQL ports, etc.)
- and more to be added


## The Why's:

This project is a personal hobby project I am using to further my understanding of Java and other coding principals such as Design patterns, Modular code, Code security, version control, and more.

I also have this personal belief that WEB 3 is not about NFTs and crypto scams, but about federation platforms. Federated networks (Threads, Bluesky) are taking off, and I see potential in this setup. I believe more and more people want to create their own slice of the internet again! Thus, why not a desktop native platform any user can download, create their own Blogger site and have friends & family follow along or make their own blogs in their own federated network!
